# Gigmate
Sydney St. Clair's Individual Project

## Problem Statement
Currently, there is no easy way for local bands to establish connections with local venues and vice versa. With Gigmate, local bands
will be able to peruse venues in the area and establish contact with them. A venue is able to get a preview of the band in their profile
with short audio demos. This will allow for both bands and venues to seek each other out, stimulating the local night life.
